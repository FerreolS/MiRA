fft_utils.i - Utility functions for working with the FFT.

fits.i - Implements support for FITS files in Yorick (should be the same
         as the fits.i file distributed with CVS Yorick).

fmin.i - Minimization of an univariate function for Yorick.  The method is
         based on original Brent's method modified to allow for different kind
         of bounds (both, left, right or none).

img.i - Routines for dealing with images (i.e. 2D arrays) in Yorick.

linop.i - General linear operator class for Yeti.

mira.i - MiRA algorithm.

oifits.i - Support of OI-FITS file for Yorick + Yeti.

plot.i - Additional routines for plotting in Yorick.

rgl.i - Implement regularization operators for iterative optimization and
         inverse problems.

utils.i - General purpose utility routines for Yorick.

mira-demo.i - Demonstration of MiRA at SPIE Conference (Marseille, 2008).

mira-test1.i - Example of image reconstruction session with MiRA
         (Multi-aperture Image Reconstruction Algorithm) using the first
         dataset from the "The 2004 Optical/IR Interferometry Imaging Beauty
         Contest" (Lawson et al., 2004).

mira-test2.i - Example of image reconstruction session with MiRA
         (Multi-aperture Image Reconstruction Algorithm) using the second
         dataset from the "The 2004 Optical/IR Interferometry Imaging Beauty
         Contest" (Lawson et al., 2004).
